        <p class="para1">He&#39;s not a word hero. He&#39;s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn&#39;t captured. The best <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/food" target="_blank">taco bowls</a> are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I&#39;m more honest and my words are more beautiful.</p>
        
        <p id="para2">You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! That other text? Sadly, it&#39;s no longer a 10. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a> is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe.</p>
        
        <p class="para3">Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">other websites.</a> I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.</p>
